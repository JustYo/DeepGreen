Experiments

Experiment 0 -- tested process with jupyter notebook, ensured everyhting could be saved
Experiment 1 -- first attempt, no regularization on latent space, l=20
Experiment 2 -- regularized latent space, l=20, no bias on latent space (unlike expt 1)
Experiment 3 -- same as expt 2, but now with l=128 AND changed the patience on the early stopping to 150 epochs (from 10 epochs)

DuffExpt Series

DuffExpt1 -- dense encoder, matched to TF1 "Experiment 04 x" and "Experiment 04 y" files
DuffExpt2 -- same, but without EarlyStopping callback function
